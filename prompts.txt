# Figma MCP Example Workflow

### Get figma file and describe it
Please connect to the figma file with the id By102wZ9ERwZKhAV7Vujvh and describe me very briefly what you can see, without mention details.

### Get design tokens
What design tokens are available? Use get_vget_variable_defs for this task.

Sort them into the following categories:

1. Global Primitives
2. Global Semantics
3. Components

Follow these rules: 
- Do not invent new design tokens; only add design tokens that are intended and exist in the figma variables.
- Keep the original variable names and possible links between them, but remove the „—components“ prefix for component related variables.

### Create theme

Create a tailwind v4 theme in @theme.css with these design tokens in a single @theme block. Use the previous category structure.

Follow these rules:
- Use tailwind best practices/naming conventions and overwrite tailwind default values when it makes sense. Example: Instead of --font-size-12: 12ox, use --text-xs: 12px
- When a component variable can be used as a global primitive or semantic design token, add them to the global primitives or semantics category and link them in the component design token.
- Do not create new spacing variables, keep the default tailwind 4px grid as foundation.
- Do not create helper classes or other utility code. Do not invent new variables or classes.

Additional information:
- All numeric values are in pixels.

// Only the values of the current mode are available.

-

Compare your result with the figma file variables. Are there any mismatches or missing design tokens?

### Create button component

Let's take a closer look at the “Button” component instance. Describe it.

-

Show me the code using the get_code tool. 

- 

Take all the information about the Button component instance and create a production-ready component in @components/Button.tsx.

Follow these rules:
- Implement the design with tailwind classes
- Use our design tokens from @theme.css where possible: Example: Instead of text-[#d84799] use bg-(--button-text-color)
- Use default tailwind utility variables for pixel-based values. Example: Instead of rounded-[8px], use rounded-lg
- Add an onClick property
- Don't invent new variants or states. Stick as close as possible to the figma design.
