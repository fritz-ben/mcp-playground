# Figma MCP Example Workflow

### Get figma file and describe it
Connect to the Figma file with ID LcBkkRdhwy8fI5xfA5rQUm and review pages 0-1 and 1-95.
- Provide a very brief high-level description of what you see.
- Give an honest opinion about Steffen’s design work.

### Get design tokens
What design tokens are available? Use get_variable_defs for this task.

Sort them into the following categories:

1. Primitives
2. Semantics
3. Text Styles
4. Components

### Create theme

Create a tailwind v4 theme in @theme.css with these design tokens in a single @theme block. Use the previous category structure. Create text style utility classes in @typo.css.

### Create button component

Let's take a closer look at the “Button” component instance. Describe it.

***

Show me the exact code that the ‘get_code’ tool returns.

***

Create a production-ready Button component in @/components/Button.tsx with the following requirements:
- Include only the variants and states that exist in Figma.
- Use Class Variance Authority (CVA) to structure Tailwind classes.
- Accept children as the button label.

***

Improve the maintainability of classes using CVA (Class Variance Authority) and add an outline variant to the button.

***

Add an icon prop to the button component using the DynamicIcon from lucide-react.

***

Inspect the title-2 / centered component instance and provide a detailed description of its structure and styling.

***

Create a production-ready Headline component in @/components/Headline.tsx with the following requirements:

- Support only the h2 level for now.
- Apply the matching text style from @typo.css.
- Include the defined hover effect with a smooth cubic-bezier transition.
- Provide a property to control text alignment.

***

Open the page with node-id 1:99, download the image named inspire-hero-title, and save it as inspire-image in the @src/assets/images folder.

***

Implement the hero-stage on page 13-502 directly in @src/App.tsx with the following requirements:
- Use the existing Headline and Button components.
- Replace the existing content with the hero-stage content.
- Use @src/assets/images/inspire-logo.png as the hero image.
